# Hi there 👋, I'm Alex Qiu

## Introduction

Hi! I’m Alex Qiu, a third-year student at UC Santa Barbara double majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Economics. I’m especially interested in the bridge between collecting meaningful data and using it to guide smarter business decisions—or simply to better understand how things work. Whether it's analyzing trends, running experiments, or building tools, I enjoy using data to make sense of the world around me. I'm always curious, always learning—whether that's through collaborating with classmates, picking up new technical skills, or just diving into a cool side project. I care a lot about doing work that has a real impact and helps people make smarter decisions.

### Paper Airplane Experiment — Full Factorial Design  
Designed and ran a **$2^3$ full factorial experiment** to evaluate the effect of paperclip weight distribution on airplane flight distance. Conducted 24 trials, modeled results with linear regression + interaction terms in R, and verified statistical assumptions.  
*Outcome:* Identified significant design impacts on aerodynamic performance (82% power)
